# Coding assignment

You have a file containing a long list of words. Write a function that, given any two words, finds the shortest
distance between them in terms of numbers of words in between.
For example, if this was the content of the file:
“We do value and reward motivation in our development team. Development is a key skill for a DevOp.”
The value of find_shortest_distance(‘motivation’, ‘development’) should be 2 (“in our”).
It can be case insensitive.

Requirements
1. Use Python 3.6 or higher
2. Include tests and a short documentation on how to run it
3. (bonus) commit your code to GitHub and, ideally, keep it in 2-4 commits so that we can see the history
(don’t squash everything in one)
